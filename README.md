# SpotifyRandom
(Rnd)Spotify looks through the albums saved in your collection and chooses a random one. If the state of the art algorithm chooses outside of your preference just swipe forward on the album art.

For now this repo is just for issues & suggestions, but in the future I will publish the source code
